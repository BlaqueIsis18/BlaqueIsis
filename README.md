What are excited about in life?
- Well to start off, I love creating an exploring . Iwouldadmit that I have lacked privelege to more of it, but with a platform given, that is what I would love to do most. 
I am very interested in technology and how it works, information and understanding the psychology of the human being in a digital world and how best the experience can be simplified using its tools. I am an artist initially, so finding new ways to define this 4IR New Age is my life time goal.
Interesting things that people may not expect ?
- To tell the truth I love suprises and I am always willing to learn something new. So I can believe that being myself will be most efficient and definite character I potray. Also into versatility I think I will bring my A-game when I get to understand the journey I am about to partake in as a UX strategist in full  depth.
Why did you apply for Umuzi?
- To be truly honest, I saw it as an opportunity to do something bigger. I am very fond of technology and its evolution, although I must admit that I am still a beginner in understanding how everything works. Plus researching a little about Umuzi I found it to be an interesting practical institution for learning and to develop my foundation into entering the world of Information, Technology and Design.
I love a challenge and why not Umuzi!
Why did you apply for UX strategy?
- I am interested in understanding application and fundamental designs in evolving the interfaces for new technologial devices and its market. Making it easier for all individuals in Africa to be easily accesible and usable. Finding new strategies and other integrated means to develop technology and communication systems need for sustainable development in the industry possibly.
